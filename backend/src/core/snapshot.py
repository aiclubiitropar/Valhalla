Snapshot -- point-in-time read-only view of WorldState (Immutable)

Every tick takes exactly one `WorldSnapshot` and hands the
*same* frozen object to every agent's tick graph via asyncio.gather(). That's
what makes parallel agent decisions safe -- nobody is reading a WorldState
that's being mutated mid-tick by someone else's action.

`WorldSnapshot` is a deliberately separate class from `WorldState`, not just
a deep copy of it. It exposes zero mutating methods, so there is no method
an agent's perceive/react/plan code could accidentally call that would
corrupt the resolve phase's assumptions. If you need a new read-only query
(e.g. "what's the nearest free table"), add it here as a method on
`WorldSnapshot` -- don't reach into `.agents`/`.occupancy` directly from
perceive.py and reimplement the same query logic in multiple places.

Usage

    from src.core.snapshot import take_snapshot

    world = WorldState()
    world.register_agent("gurnoor", Position(x=4, y=2, location_id="dorm_room_1"))

    snap = take_snapshot(world)          # take ONCE per tick, before decide phase
    snap.get_agent("gurnoor")            # read-only query
    snap.agents_near("gurnoor", radius=3)
    snap.is_free("cafeteria_table_3")

    # snap.tick = 999          <- raises, frozen model
    # snap.agents["x"] = ...   <- raises, frozen model

    Frozen copy of WorldState taken at the start of a tick's decide phase.

    Note on depth of immutability: the top-level model is frozen (you can't
    reassign `snap.tick`, `snap.agents`, etc.), and every `AgentState` inside
    `agents` is a deep copy made at snapshot time -- so even if something
    reaches in and mutates `snap.agents["x"].position`, that mutation is
    inert: it's a throwaway copy, isolated from the real WorldState and from
    every other agent's snapshot reference. It cannot leak into the resolve
    phase. Don't rely on that as a substitute for writing correct code, but
    it does mean a stray mutation is a bug in one agent's own reasoning, not
    a simulation-wide correctness issue.
