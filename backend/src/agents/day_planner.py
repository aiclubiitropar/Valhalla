"""
A script that plans the day of an agentic personality when handed over required data
Per plan takes 4 LLM calls (atlest) Coarse, Hourly, Fine, Validation, for Planning a
day in one agent's life.

Tier-1 LangGraph subgraph: agent day-planning.

Pipeline (mirrors Generative Agents' Planning module, coarse -> hourly -> fine,
with a validation/retry loop):

    generate_coarse_plan -> decompose_hourly -> decompose_fine -> validate_plan
                                                                        |
                                                        conflict? --yes-+ (loop back to generate_coarse_plan)
                                                            |
                                                            no -> END

LLM backend: Google Gemini via the `google-genai` SDK.

For now `relevant_memories` and `yesterday_summary` are expected to arrive
empty ([] / None) -- the prompts already handle that gracefully so you can
wire in real retrieval/memory later without touching this file's structure.

FILE NOTES:
Prompt structure can be improved
Places are being feed in Name : , Desc : format, this can be improved
disabled location check in validate plan : can add more places

Prompt templates have to improve

Have to figure out how to run this in the backend server, currently it is running standalone
